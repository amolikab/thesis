const *char == char can point to different strings and the value of those strings
                can be changed.
const char* == although char can point to different thgs, but we cannot change 
                the contents that the pointer points to.
                this is used while sending parameters to fcns by reference where we 
                do not want the fcn to be able to make any changes to those values.

ERR_print_errors_fp == will produce error listing by going thru all the error reports 
                        in the error queue and putting them in a file pointer(or here,
                        stderr) after erasing them from the error queue.

exit(-1)   == -1 is considered all 1's in two's complement so exit(-1) tells the program
                to exit with the highest possible exit code incase scripts have more than
                1 possible exit status
                
fprintf == writes the formatted text to the output stream specified(stdout,stderr, 
            any file that it is pointed to like *fp )

printf == writes formated text to specifically the standard output stream (ie stdout)
            printf("") == fprintf(stdout,"")
            
%i  == specifies integer
%d  == specifies unsigned integer
